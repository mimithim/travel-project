            <h3>Paris, la ville lumière</h3>
            <p>
              Paris is the city of light and dreams, but it holds much more than romance and walks along the beautiful Seine.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those interested in shopping, good pastries, new and traditional meals or visiting beautiful parks and museums, there are many possibilities. Paris is as alive during the day as it is at night and there are twenty different arrondissements to explore!
            </p>
            <p>
For those interested in culture and history, there are plenty of activities and every street corner offers something new to see and explore. Paris is not called the city of lights for nothing. Every evening the Eiffel Tower offers a light show worth seeing again and again.</p>
